## Join the Group!

Join our [Meetup.com][] group and then [send us a message] [contact]
with your GitHub username and someone will add you to the
[GitHub Group][].

## IRC

We have an IRC channel on [Freenode][].  Come join us in `#boulderhs`.

## Meetings

We normally meet the first Wednesday of each month.  Check our
[Meetup.com][] page for the meeting schedule.

Each meeting begins with a 30- to 45-minute code refactoring session.
We go through a smallish project and try to help with the following
items:

  * Getting code to compile

  * Using the type system to prevent bugs

  * Separating out IO and non-IO code

  * Making code faster

If you'd like to volunteer your code for review please
[send us a message] [contact] and let us know.
